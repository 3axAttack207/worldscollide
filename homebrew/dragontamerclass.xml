        <description>
            <p>A Human finds a dragon egg in the wild, abandoned and left to its own devices. The egg is warm to the touch and seems to pulse with a faint inner light. It hatches and looks at the human. The human leaves it alone, but it follows him around. Eventually the human picks up the baby dragon and takes it with him on his adventures. The dragon grows with the human and they become partners, taking on everything together.</p>
